# Manufacturing of a 3D printed continuum twisted tower origami landing gear for drones
This project contains the code file related to the manufacturing of a 3D printed continuum twisted tower origami landing gear for drones. GCode produced by Prusa Slicer 2.6 for the ORIGINAL PRUSA i3 MK3S+ fused deposition modeling 3D printer is manipulated such that a specific print order is enforced, leading to better print quality of a thin-walled structure.
